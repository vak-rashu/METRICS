https://github.com/vak-rashu/METRICS/edit/main/README.md#key-highlights
### INTRODUCTION

**METRICS** is a lightweight, user-friendly, CLI-based system monitoring tool designed to provide clear and accessible insights into system performance.

While working with environments like WSL or lightweight servers, traditional monitoring solutionsâ€”or more advanced stacks like Node Exporter, Prometheus, and Grafanaâ€”can feel heavy, complex, or require a steep learning curve. **METRICS** addresses this by offering a simple yet powerful alternative thatâ€™s easy to set up and maintain.

### Key Highlights:

- **Lightweight & Minimal Setup:** No complex configurations or dependencies.
  
- **Clear Visualizations:** Offers resource insights through tables, concise text output, and simple CLI-based graphs.
  
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Intuitive to use without sacrificing functionality.
  

Whether you're managing a small server or working within WSL, **METRICS** is your go-to tool for efficient, maintainable system monitoringâ€”without the bloat.
